*** : The Hubert index is a graphical method of determining the number of clusters.
                In the plot of Hubert index, we seek a significant knee that corresponds to a 
                significant increase of the value of the measure i.e the significant peak in Hubert
                index second differences plot. 
 
*** : The D index is a graphical method of determining the number of clusters. 
                In the plot of D index, we seek a significant knee (the significant peak in Dindex
                second differences plot) that corresponds to a significant increase of the value of
                the measure.

* Among all indices:                                                
* 4 proposed 2 as the best number of clusters 
* 9 proposed 3 as the best number of clusters 
* 2 proposed 4 as the best number of clusters 
* 1 proposed 5 as the best number of clusters 
* 1 proposed 6 as the best number of clusters 
* 1 proposed 8 as the best number of clusters 
* 5 proposed 10 as the best number of clusters 

                   ***** Conclusion *****                            
 
* According to the majority rule, the best number of clusters is  3
